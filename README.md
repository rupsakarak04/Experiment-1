:THEORY:
Python is a high-level, interpreted, and user-friendly programming language widely used for beginners as well as advanced applications. In this program set: Variables are used to store data values like strings, integers, floats, and booleans. Multiple assignment allows assigning values to multiple variables in a single line. The type() function is used to determine the data type of a variable. Arithmetic operators such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (), division (/), and exponentiation (*) perform mathematical calculations. The input() function is used to accept user input, which is typecast into required data types. The math library provides mathematical constants and functions such as pi and log10(). Conditional statements (if-else) help in decision-making by comparing values and executing appropriate code blocks.

ALGORITHM

Part 1:Variable Declaration and Printing

1.Assign string values to variables. 2.Assign multiple values using multiple assignment. 3.Print variables individually and using the sep parameter.

Part 2: Data Types

1.Declare variables of different data types (int, float, string, boolean). 2.Use type() to display the data type of each variable.

Part 3: Mathematical Operations

1.Assign numeric values to variables. 2.Perform arithmetic operations. 3.Store results in variables and display them.

Part 4: User Input and Operations

Accept integer values from the user.
Display the entered values.
Perform arithmetic operations on user inputs.
Part 5: Area of a Circle

Import the math module.
Accept the radius from the user.
Use the formula area = πr².
Display the calculated area.
Part 6: Logarithmic Calculation

Import the math module.
Accept a number from the user.
Calculate its base-10 logarithm.
Display the result.
Part 7: Comparison Using Conditional Statements

Accept two numbers from the user.
Compare the values using an if-else statement.
Display which number is greater.
CONCLUSION

From this program, basic Python programming concepts were successfully learned and implemented. The experiment helped in understanding variable usage, data types, arithmetic operations, user input handling, mathematical functions, and conditional logic. These concepts form the foundation for developing more complex Python programs and problem-solving skills.
