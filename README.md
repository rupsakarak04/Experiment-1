#**EXPERIMENT 1 : INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON**

##*AIM*: **To understand the Basics of Python Programming and write simple programs** 

*THEORY*:
Python is a high-level, interpreted, and object-oriented programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It allows programmers to write clear and logical code for both small and large applications. Python supports various data types such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and booleans, which are used to store and manipulate data efficiently. Multiple assignment allows assigning values to multiple variables in a single line. The type() function is used to determine the data type of a variable. Arithmetic operators such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (), division (/), and exponentiation (*) perform mathematical calculations. The input() function is used to accept user input, which is typecast into required data types. The math library provides mathematical constants and functions such as pi and log10(). Conditional statements (if-else) help in decision-making by comparing values and executing appropriate code blocks.

*ALGORITHM*:

*Program 1: Variable Declaration and Printing*
        Declare string variables and assign values to them.
        Assign multiple values to multiple variables using a single statement.
        Display the values of variables using the print() function with appropriate separators.

*Program 2: Data Types*
        Declare variables of different data types such as integer, float, string, and boolean.
        Use the type() function to identify and display the data type of each variable.

*Program 3: Mathematical Operations*
           Declare numeric variables.
           Perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication,division, and exponentiation.
            Store the results in variables and display the output.

*Program 4: User Input and Arithmetic Operations*
           Accept two integer values from the user using the input() function.
           Convert the input values into integers.
           Display the entered values.
           Perform arithmetic operations on the user-provided inputs.
           Display the results.

*Program 5: Area of a Circle*
           Import the math module.
           Accept the radius of the circle from the user.
           Calculate the area using the formula:
           Area = π × r²
           Display the calculated area of the circle.

*Program 6: Logarithmic Calculation*
            Import the math module.
            Accept a number from the user.
            Calculate the base-10 logarithm of the number using math.log10().
            Display the logarithmic value.

*Program 7: Comparison Using Conditional Statements*
            Accept two numbers from the user.
            Compare the two numbers using an if-else statement.
            Display which number is greater or if both numbers are equal.

*CONCLUSION:*
This experiment successfully introduced the fundamental concepts of Python programming. Through this experiment, the use of variables, data types, arithmetic operations, user input handling, mathematical functions, and conditional statements was understood and implemented effectively. The practical implementation of these concepts provided a strong foundation in Python programming and enhanced logical thinking skills, which are essential for developing more complex programs in future applications.
